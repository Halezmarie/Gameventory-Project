# Gameventory

Welcome to Gameventory. This app uses Sinatra and is used to help gamers organize all of their games (even if they are different consoles) in one place. When you open the app, you will be able to log in or create an account to start your journey. Once you create an account, you will be able to create games and edit, delete, or look at them in your Gameventory. You will also be able to see other uploads from different users that are using the same port.
